# Spareroom Helper
Chrome extension for spareroom.co.uk to add PCM prices next to PW ones and add a link to the commute to work on gmaps.

For now the work address is not configurable except by changing the code and is set to Immerse Learning's office.

To use:

1. go to chrome://extensions/
2. tick "developer mode" in the top right area
3. click "load unpacked extension" and put in the path to your local version of Spareroom Helper

Annoyingly, you will get a warning from Chrome every time you open it as long as this extension is enabled.
That would be fixed by publishing the extension to the store but I won't do that until I've added configurability to the work address.
